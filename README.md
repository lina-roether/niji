# Niji

Niji is an extensible theming framework that brings uniform, responsive and comfortable theming
to the tinkerer's desktop. It currently comes with builtin support for gtk apps, sway, hyprland,
kitty, and others, but it also allows you to easily add custom modules for anything you desire.
Happy hacking!

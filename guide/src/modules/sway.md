# Module `sway`

The `sway` module allows you to theme [sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway) window decorations,
as well as setting your swaybg wallpaper per theme.

## Activating

To activate the module, add it to your `config.toml`:

```toml
modules = ["sway"]
```

Niji will now output a sway configuration file to `~/.local/share/niji/sway/theme`.
To enable it, add the following line to the bottom of your sway config:

```
include ~/.local/share/niji/sway/theme
```

If you want to override any of the settings exported by niji, you can simply add more configuration
after the include statement.

## Configuration

The following global configuration options are relevant to this module:

- `font_family`
- `font_scale`
- `cursor_theme`
- `cursor_size`
- `wallpaper`

See [Configuration](../configuration.md) for a detailed explanantion. In particular,
see [Setting Wallpapers per Theme](../configuration.md#setting-wallpapers-per-theme)
for information on the `wallpaper` setting.

Additionally, these module-specific configuration options can be added to `config.toml`
(shown here with their default values):

```toml
[sway]

# Can be either "background", "surface", or "primary".
# This value determines which theme color is used for focused window borders.
focused_color = "surface"

# Can be either "background", "surface", "primary" or "secondary".
# This value determines which theme color is used for the indicator bar.
# Set to the same value as `focused_color` to hide the indicator entirely.
indicator_color = "surface"
```

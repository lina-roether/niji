# Built-in Modules

Niji includes a number of modules already built-in. You can simply
activate them by adding their names to the `"modules"` list in your
`config.toml`. For more details, see [Configuration](../configuration.md),
and the documentation of the respective module.

The built-in modules currently included with niji are:

- [`gtk`](./gtk.md): Theming GTK3 and GTK4 applications
- [`hyprland`](./hyprland.md): Theming hyprland window decorations
- [`hyprpaper`](./hyprpaper.md): Wallpaper setting support for hyprpaper
- [`kitty`](./kitty.md): Theming kitty window and terminal colors

- [`swaylock`](./swaylock.md): Theming your swaylock lock screen
- [`waybar`](./waybar.md): A fully managed waybar theme

If there is something missing from this list that you'd like to have, take

# Custom Themes

Custom niji themes are defined using [TOML](https://toml.io) files placed
into the `~/.config/niji/themes` directory, with the filename (without the extension)
matching the theme name.

The file is split into two sections: `[ui]` for GUI colors, and `[terminal]` for
terminal colors. All colors are defined using `#RRGGBB` or `#RRGGBBAA` syntax.

## `[ui]`

The `[ui]` section defines colors for graphical interfaces. It also contains
the option `color_scheme`, which should be either `"light"` or `"dark"` to tell
GUI toolkits whether the theme should be considered a light or a dark theme.

The section contains the following options:

| Option            | Description                                                                                                       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `color_scheme`    | Whether the theme should be considered light or dark. Takes only the values `"light"` and `"dark"`.               |

| `border`          | The color of borders around certain elements. May be set to transparent (`#00000000`) to remove borders.          |
| `shadow`          | The color of drop shadow around certain elements. May be set to transparent (`#00000000`) to remove drop shadows. |

text_surface = "#c0caf5"
primary = "#a9b1d6"
text_primary = "#1a1b26"
secondary = "#73daca"
border = "#1a1b26"
shadow = "#10101080"

success = "#73daca"
text_success = "#e0af68"

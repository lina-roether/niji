# Built-in Themes

Niji includes a number of built-in themes. You can preview them using the
`niji theme show <name>` command, and select them using `niji theme set <name>`.
For more information, refer to [Command Line Interface](./cli.md).

The built-in themes currently included with niji are:

- `catpuccin-frappe`
- `catpuccin-latte`
- `dracula`
- `gruvbox`
- `gruvbox-light`
- `tokyonight`

To list these themes, along with any custom or separately installed themes, use
the `niji theme list` command.

If there is something missing from this list that you'd like to have, take a look
at [Custom Themes](./custom-themes.md).

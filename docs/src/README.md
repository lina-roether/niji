# Niji

Niji is an extensible theming framework that brings uniform, responsive and comfortable theming to the tinkerer's desktop.
It currently comes with builtin support for gtk apps, sway, hyprland, kitty, and others, but it also allows you to easily
add custom modules for anything you desire.

Refer to [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) for a quick guide on how to set niji up,
or take a look at [Configuration](./configuration.md) and [Built-in Modules](./modules/)
for a more in-depth reference of niji's capabilities.
